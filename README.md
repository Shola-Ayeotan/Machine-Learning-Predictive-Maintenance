# Machine-Learning-Predictive-Maintenance
This project developed a predictive maintenance model using vibration sensor data to classify faults, optimize maintenance operations, and improve machinery reliability. 

I leveraged machine learning techniques to create a fault detection model for a manufacturing plant. 

By applying Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models with hyperparameter tuning, over 90% accuracy was achieved on the test dataset, highlighting the potential for accurate fault detection. This project also utilized MLflow experiment tracking to log and track model performance, enabling easy retrieval and analysis of predictions. 

These findings have far-reaching implications for the manufacturing industry, paving the way for improved machine efficiency and cost-effective maintenance strategies.
